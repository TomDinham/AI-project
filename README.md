# AI-project
My first AI project using state machine, fuzzy logic, path finding and AI vehicles
This AI project was to develop a scene for a game that included multiple AI techniques that worked together in one scene. 
For my scene, i used state machines to control the AI's behaviour and decisions and then implemented NAV mesh to create zombies 
that hunted the VIP character. For the VIP, i used fuzzy logic that would decide if they should fight or flee based on there 
health and how close the zombies were. 
Finally, i implemented an AI vehicle that was patrolling the scene on a set path.
